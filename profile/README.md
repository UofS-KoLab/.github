## Manners & Guidelines
1. Cleanup after youself. Do regular cleanup of unnecessary materials and repositories in the organization.
2. Always open pull requests to merge into the default (main) branch of repos.
3. Always open issues to keep track of the project contributions and progress.
4. Use the github projects for task management sparingly.
5. Write device and os agnostic code wherever possible.
6. Write meangingful commit messages.
7. Always commit small changes and push. Big commits are harder to debug.
8. Ensure that project is in a "running" state locally before pushing to `dev` or `main` branch.
